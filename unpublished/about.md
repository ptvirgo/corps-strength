## About

You're probably trying to balance a crazy schedule while wanting to improve your
fitness.  I hope this tool helps you on your path.

In addition to helping me stay in shape, I wrote this as an exercise to
demonstrate what I've been learning about software development.  It's running
with Perl, SQLite and Javascript.  I also wrote the HTML templates and CSS.  I
make no claims to graphic design skills.  See my [github
account](https://github.com/ptvirgo) for further insight.
