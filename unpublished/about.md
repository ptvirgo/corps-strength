## About

You're probably trying to balance a crazy schedule while wanting to improve your
fitness.  I hope this tool helps you on your path.

In addition to helping me stay in shape, I wrote this as an exercise to
demonstrate what I've been learning about software development. It's running
with Perl, SQLite and Javascript.  I also wrote the HTML templates and CSS.
I make no claims to graphic design skills.

There are probably bugs, especially since this is my first attempt at releasing
software into the wild.  If you'd care to provide feedback or help me make
improvements, you can do so [on
github](https://github.com/ptvirgo/lunchbreak-workout).
