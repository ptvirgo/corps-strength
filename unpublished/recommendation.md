## Recommendation

If you're working the kind of desk-jockey job that normally destroys a person's
health, and a regular practice of going to the gym would steal too much precious
time from family and friends, I recommend reading ["Corps
Strength"](http://corpsstrength.com) by MGySgt Paul J. Roarke Jr.

Roarke drew on years of experience training Marines to develop an extremely
effective, simple fitness program.  It can be followed with only a few hours a
week in-any environment you are likely to encounter.  His no-nonsense focus on
working-fitness emphasizes that anyone can have health, strength, and endurance
to spare without having to turn exercise into a part-time career.

I've been working in a career that normally destroys people's physical health.
The stereotypical IT guy needs to lose over a hundred pounds and struggles with
two flights of stairs.  We've all seen this, in almost any industry.
Professionals aren't lazy.  We work crazy hours and need what little time and
energy is left to touch base with the people we love.
  
Roarke's book gave me a solution that I could implement on 2 - 3 lunch breaks
per week.  Thanks to his routine, I'm not worrying that I might die of a heart
attack in my 40s.  I'm participating in the occasional Spartan Race. I'm enjoying
the fact that my wife tells my I'm one of the strongest and most attractive
people she's met. I'm reminding friends and family that fitness is available to
anyone.

I hope that by sharing this little tool I've can encouraged you to build some
health and strength into your life.  You don't have to get sucked into a
constant state of stress and exhaustion.  Grab a copy of Roarke's book, swing
back here when you've got a spare lunch break, and stay strong.
